On iRods the files are grouped by collection, and the collections tell you the project which is a unix group \
and thus can be linked to the group id .

The query 
iquest -z humgen --no-page "%s???%s???%s???%s" "SELECT COLL_NAME,DATA_NAME,min(DATA_CREATE_TIME),sum(DATA_SIZE)" > test.txt with formatting

User and owner are many to one with file. We do have files size and creation date. They both can differ for replicates which have the same data_id and collection_id so care is needed. 

Because of the way iRods assumes distinct selections unless set otherwise, you can get several rows per file from size and creation date when you thought there was just one. 

The unique owner for a file should be the project and the project is part of the collection name, like /humgen/projects/ddd . 

Where there is no projects part of the collection, hgi is returned as the group
